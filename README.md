# Sokoban
 **Sokoban** is a type of [puzzle video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_video_game), in which the player pushes [crates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crate#Wooden_crates) or [boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooden_box) around in a [warehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse), trying to get them to storage locations. I made this When I studied about Windows API with books named [윈도우즈 API 정복](http://www.hanbit.co.kr/store/books/look.php?p_code=B5569582339 ). I added some features more in what it is introduced in the book.
